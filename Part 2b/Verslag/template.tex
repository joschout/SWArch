\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The goal of this project was to design a document processing system. In this document, we describe the final architecture, which was designed based on the requirements from the domain analysis and the priorities of these requirements given by our stakeholders. The provided initial architecture was used as a starting point to achieve this.
Section \ref{sec:overview} lists the architectural decisions for all non-functional requirements and discusses the final architecture.
Section \ref{sec:client-server} provides and discusses the main context and decomposition diagrams of our architecture (i.e. the context and primary diagram of the component-and-connector view) along with a discussion of the main architectural decisions involved.
Section \ref{sec:decomposition} provides and discusses the more fine-grained decompositions of some of the major components in the main decomposition.
Section \ref{sec:deployment} provides and discusses the deployment of the components of the component-and-connector view on physical nodes.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:scenarios} illustrates how our architecture accomplishes the most important functionality and data flows using sequence diagrams.
Afterwards, Appendix \ref*{app:catalog} lists and describes all components of the component-and-connector view and their interfaces and Appendix \ref*{app:datatypes} lists and describes the data types used in these interfaces.
\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}
This section gives a high-level but complete overview of the system: it lists the design decisions for all non-functional requirements and provides a discussion concerning the strong and weak points of the architecture.
\subsection{Architectural decisions}
In this section, we give an overview of the architectural decisions made in our architecture in order to achieve the requirements given in the domain analysis and the residual drivers given in the provided initial architecture. However, we will not repeat any decisions that were already documented in this provided initial architecture as they can be found there.

\paragraph{Av1a \& Av2a\@: Notifying the appropriate operator within 1 minute}
\textit{Av1a} and \textit{Av2a} require the system to notify the an eDocs operator within 1 minute. To achieve this, the \texttt{NotificationHandler} forwards all incoming operator notifications to the \texttt{EDocsAdminFacade}, which in turn delivers these to the external \texttt{EDocsAdminFacade}. To ensure that notifications get sent to the eDocs operator in a timely fashion, both the \texttt{EDocsAdminFacade} and the \texttt{NotificationHandler} are deployed on the same node, which is separated from all other nodes to increase performance.\\
For more details, we refer to Section \ref{subsubsec:Av1a-Av2a} and Section \ref{sec:deployment}.

\paragraph{Av1b\@: Storing the status of an individual job}
\textit{Av1b} requires the system to store the status of an individual job. To achieve this, the \texttt{JobManager} accepts all read and write requests regarding the storage of job data, including status information.\\
For more details, we refer to Section \ref{subsubsec:Av1b} and Section \ref{subsec:decomp-JobManager}.

\paragraph{Av2b\@: Temporarily storing documents that should be delivered via the personal document store for at least 3 hours in case the PDSDB is unavailable and providing a clear message to users in order to fail gracefully}
\textit{Av2b} requires (1) documents that should be delivered via the personal document store to be cached for at least 3 hours in case of unavailability and (2) providing a clear message to the recipient in this case. To achieve this, we introduced the \texttt{DocumentStorageCache}: this component temporarily stores the \texttt{DocumentIds} and corresponding \texttt{UserIds} of all generated documents that are to be delivered to the \texttt{PDSDB} during downtime of the latter component up to a maximum of 3 hours. When the \texttt{PDSDB} turns operational again, it notifies the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} with a sign of life, which in turn retrieves all documents and their corresponding meta data from the \texttt{DocumentDB} using the previously mentioned ids and subsequently stores them in the \texttt{PDSDB} after conversion of the \texttt{DocumentMetaData}.\\
Note that the user therefore perceives a maximum total downtime of 3 hours and that the \texttt{RecipientFacade} is in charge of presenting the user with a clear error message after having performed a read request in his or her behalf that has failed due to the unavailability of the \texttt{PDSDB}. However, during the time needed for the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} to transfer all documents and meta data that the cached ids refer to, it is possible that the user is not able to access (part of) his or her documents via the \texttt{PDSDB}, more specifically those that are still being transferred. Since the requirements do not demand the user to be able to regain full functionality of his or her personal document store at once, finding a better alternative for this gradual revival of the \texttt{PDSDB} is out of scope.\\
Finally, we would like to stress that the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} and the \texttt{PDSDB} are necessarily deployed on different nodes for the former to be able to do its caching job while the latter is not operational during downtime. More precisely, the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} implicitly pings the \texttt{PDSDB} when storing document data in it. The echo message then, in turn, consists of the write confirmation that is subsequently received. If one of those writes should fail, all subsequent writes are internally converted into pairs of \texttt{DocumentId}-\texttt{UserId} writes to the aforementioned cache. Once the \texttt{PDSDB} is operational again and all cached ids are processed, subsequent writes to the \texttt{PDSDB} will no longer be redirected through the \texttt{DocumentStorageCache}.\\
For more details, we refer to Section \ref{subsubsec:Av2b}, Section \ref{subsec:decomp-DocumentStorageFunctionality} and Section \ref{sec:deployment}.

\paragraph{Av3\@: Zoomit failure}
\textit{Av3} requires the System to be able to (1) autonomously detect when an invoice is not accepted by Zoomit, (2) temporarily store at least 2 days of these invoices locally until they are accepted by Zoomit, (3) keep on retrying to deliver a failed invoice to Zoomit in a proper fashion and (4) notify an eDocs operator after 5 failed attempts of at least 10 different invoices. To achieve this, the \texttt{ZoomitFacade} is able to receive a delivery confirmation from Zoomit (i.e. the invoice was accepted). Furthermore, the \texttt{ZoomitDeliveryCache} caches all \texttt{Documents} and corresponding \texttt{DeliveryInfo} for which the \texttt{ZoomitFacade} did not (yet) receive a delivery confirmation up to a maximum of 2 days of documents.\\
The \texttt{ZoomitFacade} periodically retries to deliver the cached documents to Zoomit in a proper fashion by storing both the number of delivery attempts and the 
For more details, we refer to Section \ref{subsubsec:Av3} and Section \ref{subsec:decomp-DeliveryFunctionality}.

\paragraph{P2\@: Document lookups}
\subparagraph{Sharding for DocumentDB for P2}
In order to improve performance of the \texttt{DocumentDB}, we chose to partition this database into multiple shards. This approach was driven by the need for fast response time while keeping in mind the high storage cost for documents. More precisely, a \texttt{ShardingManager} is responsible for reading and writing all documents in one of the \texttt{DocumentDBShards}, making sure that every document is stored only once. This sharding technique provides roughly the same advantages in response time as active replication, but is significantly less costly when it comes to storage capacity.
Note that there must also be a (sub)component monitoring all requests to the shards, in order to throttle excessive requests when necessary. Since this is a rather simple task and the (sub)component must be aware of the details concerning the sharding architecture to efficiently fulfil its purpose, this functionality is delegated to the \texttt{ShardingManager} itself. Finally, this \texttt{ShardingManager} is also responsible for implicitly pinging all \texttt{DocumentDBShards} upon reading and writing in them.

\subparagraph{Dedicated DocumentDB and JobDB}
Since a large number of document lookups and downloads should not affect the performance of other functionality of the system, both link mappings and documents are stored in dedicated databases, each deployed on a different node. This decision ensures that documents can be looked up via the personal document store or a notification in a timely fashion, because it prohibits either of those two components to be a bottleneck in the document lookup process. Since, according to the previous decomposition, the \texttt{PDSDB} is deployed on a separate node too, this component's performance is already satisfactory and no changes need to be made to improve it.

\paragraph{P3\@: Status overview for customer administrators}

\paragraph{M1\@: New type of document: bank statements}

\paragraph{M2\@: Multiple print \& postal services}

\paragraph{M3\@: Dynamic selection of the cheapest of print \& postal services}

\subsection{Discussion}
Use this section to discuss your architecture in retrospect.
For example, what are the strong points of your architecture?
What are the weak points? Is there anything you would have done otherwise with
your current experience?
Are there any remarks about the architecture that you would give to your
customers?
Etc.

\paragraph{Alternative for DocumentStorageCache}
We could just as well do without the previously introduced \texttt{DocumentStorageCache} by letting the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} actively look for documents in the \texttt{DocumentDB} that are not yet, but should be, present in the \texttt{PDSDB} upon revival of the \texttt{PDSDB}. A clear advantage of this approach is that the downtime of the \texttt{PDSDB} component is no longer restricted by the aforementioned 3-hour cache. An important disadvantage, however, lies in the fact that the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} is burdened with a significant amount of extra work and will require more expensive hardware to cope with this. Since the support for a longer downtime of the \texttt{PDSDB} is out of scope, this approach was not chosen.

%Merk op: als alternatief hadden we gedacht aan GEEN actieve heartbeat vanuit de PDSDB bij het online komen, maar bij een schrijfpoging naar de PDSDB als impliciete ping wanneer er een document opgeslagen wordt. Het probleem hierbij is dat wanneer er al even geen documenten genereerd zijn maar er toch noch documentreferenties in de cache zitten en op dat moment de PDSDB online komt, een registered recipient die documenten niet kan opvragen.

\section{Client-server view (UML Component diagram)}\label{sec:client-server}
\paragraph{Context diagram}
The context diagram of the component-and-connector view is given in Figure \ref{fig:cc-context}. As shown, six distinct types of external components communicate with the system:
(i) the EDocsAdminClient represents a client device of an administrator of eDocs that communicates with the eDocs System,
(ii) the CustomerOrganizationClient represents a client device of a Customer Organization (i.e. Customer Administrator and Customer Information System) that communicates with the eDocs System,
(iii) the RecipientClient represents a client device of an unregistered or registered recipient of eDocs that communicates with the eDocs System,
(iv) the ZoomitChannel represents the servers of Zoomit to which documents can be sent for further delivery,
(v) the Print\&PostalServiceChannel represents the servers of a print \& postal service to which documents can be sent for further delivery,
(vi) the EmailChannel represents a mail server of an e-mail provider to which documents can be sent for further delivery.
Notice that each external interface on the client side is provided by a separate facade component and that each delivery channel interfaces with the \texttt{DeliveryFunctionality} component.

\subsection{Main architectural decisions}
Discuss your architectural decisions for the most important requirements in
more detail using the components of the client-server view.
Pay attention to the solutions that you employed and the alternatives that you
considered.
The explanation here must be self-contained and complete.
Imagine you had to describe how the architecture supports the core
functionality to someone that is looking at the client-server view only.
Hide unnecessary details (these should be shown in the decomposition view).

\paragraph{UserFacade}
We introduce this component to be able to distinguish between registered recipients and unregistered recipients in the first steps of the document lookup process. The \texttt{UserFacade} also maps incoming links to documents that are located either in the \texttt{PDSDB} or in the \texttt{DocumentDB} by first fetching the correct mapping from the \texttt{LinkMappingDB} mentioned above. Another responsibility of the \texttt{UserFacade} is marking documents as received, since this is the last internal component through which the document is passed before the requesting recipient actually receives it and failure of another component in the document lookup pipeline can no longer prevent this from happening.

\paragraph{PDSFacade}
This component handles all read requests that are intended for the personal document store. This extra level of indirection calculates and aggregates all intermediate query results as to relieve the \texttt{PDSDB} of this burden, which is also the reason why both components are best deployed on different nodes. Upon querying the personal document store, this component first collects the recipient's documents' meta data and subsequently performs queries on this collection. This approach introduces no significant overhead, because only those documents that are needed, will be fetched in their entirety. It is also the responsibility of the \texttt{PDSFacade} to check the recipient's ID against the recipient ID that can be retrieved from the document meta data and to only pass on those documents for which they are a match.

\paragraph{DocumentStorageManager}
The storage of documents is handled by the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager}, which receives generated documents from the intermediary \texttt{OtherFunctionality2} component and stores them in either the \texttt{DocumentDB} (for unregistered recipients) or in both the \texttt{DocumentDB} and the \texttt{PDSDB} (for registered recipients) according to the method that is invoked on it. The necessity for this component follows from the fact that synchronisation is needed between the two storage components mentioned above. Note that the PDSDocMgmt interface in the \texttt{PDSDB} component now requires an extra method to save documents.

\paragraph{LinkManager}
Motivatie voor LinkManager: Checks expiration date ALS DAT NODIG IS--> reason: links naar de pdsdb vervallen niet (zolang de gebruik geregistreerd is)
LinkManager maps link to (document ID, place where the document is stored)-pairs --> REASON: the unique link has two possible sources: an e-mail to an unregistered recipient or an email to a registered recipient. For an unregistered recipient, the RecipientFacade must look with the documentid for the document in the documentDB. For a registered recipient, the RecipientFacade must look with the documentid for the document  in the PDSDB. (Mogelijk een boolean ofzo)
Does NOT do mapping removal after x years --> there has to be a notification when the link has expired

of why these choices where made.

\subsubsection{Av2b\@: Temporarily storing documents that should be delivered via the personal document store for at least 3 hours in case the PDSDB is unavailable and providing a clear message to users in order to fail gracefully}\label{subsubsec:Av2b}
% MERK OP: De DocumentDB en PSDDB slaan documenten NIET meer op dezelfde manier op. De DocumentDB slaat het email adres van een document mee op, indien het document naar een email adres opgestuurd is. Dit omdat bij het registeren documenten op basis van email adres opgevraagd moeten kunnen worden. In de DocumentDB zit GEEN RecipientId. In de PDSDB zit er daarentegen WEL een RecipientId, maar GEEN emailadres opgeslagen.

\section{Scenarios}\label{sec:scenarios}
Illustrate how your architecture fulfills the most important data flows.
As a rule of thumb, focus on the scenario of the domain description.
Describe the scenario in terms of architectural components using UML Sequence
diagrams and further explain the most important interactions in text.
Illustrating the scenarios serves as a quick validation of the completeness of
your architecture.
If you notice at this point that for some reason, certain functionality or
qualities are not addressed sufficiently in your architecture, it suffices to
document this, together with a rationale of why this is the case according to
you.
You do not have to further refine you architecture at this point.

\subsection{Scenario 1}
Shortly describe the scenario shown in this subsection.
Show the complete scenario using one or more sequence diagrams.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}
    \missingfigure[figwidth=0.8\textwidth]{Sequence diagram scenario 1}
    \caption{The system behavior for the first scenario.
        }\label{fig:seq_scenario1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{A registered recipient logs in}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_UC1LogIn} depicts the sequence diagram of a Registered Recipient logging in, according to \emph{UC1: Log in}. The Registered Recipient provides his details to the \texttt{RecipientFacade}. The \texttt{Authentication} compares these credentials to those stored in the \texttt{OtherDB}. if the given credentials match the stored credentials, a new session is opened in the \texttt{SessionDB} and the corresponding session identifier is returned to the registered recipient. Otherwise, an InvalidCredentialsException is thrown.\\
Note that the use case \emph{UC1: Log in} also has the Customer Organization as a primary actor. The login procedure for customer organizations is almost identical to the procedure for registered recipient, which is why we do not provide a separate sequence diagram for this primary actor. Compared to figure \ref{fig:seq_UC1LogIn}, the Customer Organization sends it login request to the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade} instead of the \texttt{RecipientFacade}. Also, another method call to \texttt{OtherDB} is used to ask for the credentials of a customer organization.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Seq_UC1LogIn.png}
    \caption{The login behaviour of a Registered Recipient.
        }\label{fig:seq_UC1LogIn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A registered recipient logs out}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_UC2LogOut} shows the behaviour of a Registered Recipient logging out, according to \emph{UC2: Log out}. The Registered Recipient provides his recipient id and session id to the \texttt{RecipienntFacade}. The \texttt{AuthenticationHandler} first verifies the session (figure \ref{fig:seq_UC2LogOut}). If the session is valid, it logs out the Registered Recipient.\\ Note that the logout procedure for Customer Organizations is almost the same. The only difference is that the Customer Organization sends his logout request to the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade} instead of the \texttt{RecipientFacade}. Because of this reason, we do not give a separate sequence diagram for the Customer Organization logging out.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Seq_UC2LogOut.png}
    \caption{The system behavior for the first scenario.
        }\label{fig:seq_UC2LogOut}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Updating a document template}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_UC20UpdateDocumentTemplate} shows the flow when a Customer Administrator updates the template used for generating documents of a given type. It corresponds to \emph{UC20: Update document template}. It consists of two main parts. First, the customer administrator asks what the possible document types are that the customer organization is allowed to generate. The system verifies whether the session of the customer administrator is valid (as detailed in figure \ref{fig:seq_VerifySession} and then returns a list of the allowed document types using the \texttt{OtherDB}.  Together with the allowed document types, it returns the  time when the currently stored templates corresponding to the document types were uploaded.\\
Secondly, the customer administrator provides the document type it wants to update and the new template to the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade}. After verifying the validity of the session again (figure \ref{fig:seq_VerifySession}), the \texttt{CustomerOrganization} asks the \texttt{OtherDB} to check whether the document type provided by the customer organization is valid and allowed. If it is not allowed or invalid, an InvalidDocumentTypeException gets thrown. Otherwise, the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade} stores the template in the \texttt{OtherDB} together with the time when it has received the template, the document type and the customer organization id.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Seq_UC20UpdateDocumentTemplate.png}

        }\label{fig:seq_UC20UpdateDocumentTemplate}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Verifying a session}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_VerifySession} how it is verified whether a session is valid. The \texttt{AuthenticationHandler} uses the \texttt{SessionDB} to verify whether each incoming session identifier belongs to an existing session. If it belongs to an existing session, the corresponding session attributes are returned to the caller, otherwise an NoSuchSessionException is thrown.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Seq_VerifySession.png}
    \caption{verifySession: sequence diagram depicting the verification whether a session is valid.
        }\label{fig:seq_VerifySession}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Initiating document processing}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_UC3InitiateDocumentProcessing} shows how a customer organization initiates a batch of document processing jobs. Recurring and non-recurring batches are indicated using the \texttt{isRecurring} boolean value. If the batch is non-recurring, the customer organization can indicate another priority than the default priority of that customer organization if the batch sould be handled with another priority than the default priority.  For recurring batches, it does not matter if a priority is given, as the default priority will be used. the customer organization also delivers the raw data as a \texttt{rawDataPackage} and the meta-data of the batch to the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade}. After verification of the session identifier (figure \ref{fig:seq_VerifySession}), the \texttt{CustomerOrganizationFacade} will put a \texttt{TimeStamp} of the time when this method is called in the \texttt{batchMetaData} and forward all the information to \texttt{RawDataHandler}, while alsp indicating if the batch is (non-)recurring.\\

Figure \ref{fig:seq_VerifyRawData} depicts the first part of the method call in \texttt{RawDataHandler}, which will verify whether the raw data is valid. First, \texttt{RawDataHandler} checks whether the customer organization is allowed to generated the given document type. If it is allowed, the received raw data packet will be validated, e.g  there will be checked whether the content of the received Excel file can be read or whether a received XML file is correctly formatted. If it is not valid, an exception is thrown. Otherwise, depending on if the batch is  recurring, the \texttt{RawDataHandler} will query the SLA in the \texttt{OtherDB} to check if the number of raw data entries in the raw data package is allowed. If the number of entries exceeds this maximum, an exception is thrown. Next, each individual entry will be checked on validity, so the \texttt{RawdataHandler} knows which \texttt{RawData} entries are valid and which are not.\\

After verification, figure \ref{fig:seq_UC3InitiateDocumentProcessing} shows that the \texttt{RawDataHandler} will only use the given priority if the batch is non-recurring. Otherwise, it will use the default priority. The deadline of the document processing jobs is calculated and put into the \texttt{BatchMetaData}, after which the \texttt{RawData} entries and \texttt{BatchMetaData} is stored in the \texttt{OtherDB}. The \texttt{RawDataHandler} asks the \texttt{JobFacade} to create jobs for the valid raw data entries and to initiate document processing for those jobs.\\

Figure \ref{fig:seq_CreateJobs} shows the \texttt{JobFacade} creating and storing jobs for the valid raw data entries, after which it inserts these jobs into the \texttt{Scheduler}.

When the \texttt{PDSDB} fails, the documents that are supposed to also be saved in the \texttt{PDSDB} are saved in the \texttt{DocumentDB}, just as usual. But in this case the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} also stores the \texttt{DocumentIds} and \texttt{UserIds} of those documents in the \texttt{DocumentStorageCache} for at least 3 hours. This way, the \texttt{DocumentStorageManager} can transfer these documents from the \texttt{DocumentDB} to the \texttt{PDSDB} using this information if the \texttt{PDSDB} comes back online within 3 hours. The requirements do not specify what happens after 3 hours, so in this architecture, the behaviour after those 3 hours is undefined.

\subsection{TemplateCache}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:}  The \texttt{TemplateCache} caches the templates which are most recently used for document generation. The \texttt{Completer} has to fetch a templateevery time a \texttt{Generator} instance requests new jobs, while the template will be the same for all jobs belonging to the same batch. The \texttt{TemplateCache} avoids that the template storage system becomes a bottleneck for document generations. The templates are cached based on the \texttt{CustomerId} of a Customer Organization, the type of the document and the date and time at which the batch was provided by the Customer Organization (in order to account for template updates).

\section{Defined data types}\label{app:datatypes}
List and describe all data types defined in your interface specifications. List
them alphabetically for ease of navigation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{BatchId}: A piece of data uniquely identifying a batch of document processing jobs in the system. This architecture does not specify the exact format of this identifier, but possibilites are a long integer, a string, a URL etc.
	
	\item \texttt{BatchMetaData}: A data structure listing the metadata belonging to a batch of jobs. This includes the \texttt{CustomerID} of a Customer Organization, the \texttt{DocumentType} of the documents to be generated, the \texttt{TimeStamp} of when the batch was received, \dots
	
	\item \texttt{CompletePartialBatchData}: A complex data structure listing all data a \texttt{Generator} needs to complete document generation jobs that are part of the same batch. It contains an array of \texttt{Tuple<JobId, RawData>}. The \texttt{JobIds} identify jobs that are all part of the same batch. The \texttt{RawData} belongs to these document processing jobs. Also listed in the \texttt{BatchMetaData} are the values of the \texttt{BatchMetaData}, \texttt{Key} and \texttt{Template} data types belonging to the batch.	
	
	 \texttt{CompletePartialBatchData} also contains a \texttt{BatchMetaData} entry, a \texttt{Key} and a \texttt{Template}. \emph{Important to note:} a value of CompletePartialBatchData contains all information necessary to generate \textbf{some} jobs of belonging to same batch. It does not have to contain the information of all jobs belonging to same batch.

	\item \texttt{Credentials}: The authentication credentials of a Registered Recipient or Customer Organization. The credentials always contain an identifier of the recipient or customer organization and a proof of his or her identity. The architecture does not specify the specific credentials used, but a possibility is using a username and password.
	 
	\item \texttt{CustomerId}: A piece of data uniquely identifying a Customer Organization in the system. This architecture does not specify the exact format of this identifier, but possibilites are a long integer, a string, a URL etc.
	
	\item \texttt{DeliveryInfo}:
	
	\item \texttt{Document}: A data file corresponding to a document.  The architecture specifies the format of this data type as a PDF-file. 
	
	\item \texttt{DocumentId}: A piece of data uniquely identifying a document in the system.

	\item \texttt{DocumentMetaData}: 
	%PDSDBMetaData wordt niet meer gebruikt
	%The meta-data stored with a document in the \texttt{DocumentDB}. This meta-data differs from the \texttt{PDSDBMetaData}, in that it does not contain a \texttt{UserId}, but it does contain an \texttt{Email} address.
	
	\item \texttt{DocumentPriority}: A data type representing the priority of document generation jobs. They have values representing the Critical, Diamond, Gold and Silver priorities. The exact format of this data type is not specified by the architecture.
	
	\item \texttt{DocumentType}: A piece of data describing the type of a document. This architecture does not specify the exact format of this data type, but possibilities are a long integer, a string, a URL etc.
	
	\item \texttt{Echo}: The response to a ping message. This data element does not contain any meaningful data.
	
	\item \texttt{Error}: Description of data type.
	
    \item \texttt{GeneratordId}: A piece of data uniquely identifying a \texttt{Generator} in the system. This architecture does not specify the exact format of this identifier, but possibilites are a long integer, a string, a URL etc.
    
    \item \texttt{JobBatch}: Description of data type.
    
    \item \texttt{JobId}: A piece of data uniquely identifying a document processing job in the system.
    
    \item \texttt{Key}: A data structure containing the key of the Customer Organization which is used to sign its documents during the generation process. This architecture does not specify the exact format of this data type, but possibilites are a long integer, a string, a URL etc.
    
    \item \texttt{NotificationMessage}: A textual message which can be used to include extra information about the event of the notification.
