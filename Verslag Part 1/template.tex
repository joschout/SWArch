    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The Registered recipient indicates that he or she wants to search for a specific document, e.g. in the overview of received documents (cf. \emph{UC4: Consult personal document store}.
       \item The System presents to the Registered recipient one or more ways to specify criteria that the document he/she is looking for must meet.
       \item The System searches in its archive and looks up the documents that meet the specified requirements. The System presents the found documents to the Registered recipient.
