\section{Non-functional requirements}\label{sec:non-functional}
In this section, we model the non-functional requirements for the system in the
form of \emph{quality attribute scenarios}. We provide for each type
(availability, performance and modifiability) one requirement.

\subsection{Availability}
\subsubsection{\emph{Av1}: Document processing infrastructure failure}
The internal (sub-)system responsible for processing the raw data into documents fails or crashes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} Internal
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:} The internal (sub-)system responsible for generating documents fails or crashes.

    \item \textbf{Artifact:} Internal subsystem
    \item \textbf{Environment:} Normal execution
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item This does not affect the availability of other subsystems, such as (i) the availability of the personal document store, (ii) the delivery of already generated documents, (iii) the availability of persistent data such as user data and billing data, etc..
			\item This does not lead to the loss of raw data.
			\item This does not lead to the loss of already generated documents.
			\item This does not lead to critical documents not being processed on time.
            \item Prevention
				\begin{itemize}
				\item The system responsible for processing raw data should have a guaranteed maximal down-time.
				\end{itemize}
           	 \item Detection
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The eDocs Operators are notified of this problem.
					\item The System is able to detect this problem and goes into degraded modus:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Raw data to be processed is stored and processed when the processing system returns operational.
				\item Fail gracefully: if the system fails while handeling a processing job, the documents it did finish generating are stored in the archive as in a regular processing job.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
            \item Resolution
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The notified eDocs Operators address the problem, e.g. by replacing failed hardware or by restarting the software.
			\item The System automatically finishes the planned processing jobs, including the ones it possibly was handling during the failure.
		\end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
            \item Prevention
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The System should be down for at most 14 hours per year, in time spans of at most two hours. The time between two down-time periods should be at least the time necessary to process all pending documents to be generated.
			\item The time necessary to process raw data into a document should be at most the time agreed upon in the SLA minus the maximal consecutive downtime. This way, there is a time buffer to take into account the possible down-time. More specifically:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Critical documents, which have a deadline to be processed within 5 hours, should take at most three hours to process.
			\item Non-recurring documents with a diamond priority, which have a deadline of maximal 12 hours to process, should take at most 10 hours to process.
			\item Non-recurring documents with a gold priority, which have a deadline of maximal 24 hours to process, should take at most 22 hours to process.
			\item  Non-recurring documents with a silver priority, which have a deadline of maximal 48 hours to process, should take at most 46 hours to process.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
            \item Detection
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Detection of failed hardware or crashed software happens within 5 seconds.
			\item The eDocs operators are notified within 1 minute.
			\item In the transition between normal and degraded modus, no document are lost.
		\end{itemize}
            \item Resolution
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It should be possible for the eDocs operators to address the problem in within 2 hours.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{\emph{P1}: raw data transfer }
It should  be possible to send raw data to the eDocs system in a timely fashion, even in case of a large number of customer organisations attempting to access this raw data transfer interface (e.g. at the end of each month or at the end of the default fiscal year).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} Customer organisation
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A registered customer organisation sends (a batch of) raw data to the eDocs system
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Artifact:} The eDocs system interface through which raw data is received
    \item \textbf{Environment:} Normal execution
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item The eDocs system is able to receive raw data in a timely fashion while the rate of arriving raw data is lower than a certain value.
		\item If the raw data arrive at a higher rate than this value, the system throttles the excessive arrivals so that this amount of raw data continues to be transfered in a timely fashion.
		\item A large amount of raw data transfer should not affect the performance of other functionality of the eDocs system.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item While the rate of arriving raw data is lower than 5000 records / second, the eDocs system should be able to receive at least 95\% of all records within 2 seconds and 99\% within 5 seconds
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modifiability}
\subsubsection{\emph{M1}: Different authentication methods}
eDocs currently authenticates its registered users (both customer organisations and their clients) in a uniform way through username-password protection. As this is not considered to be very secure, the IT department might decide to include some other form of authentication someday, either replacing or complementing the current authentication procedure.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} IT department
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The IT department wants to include another form of security in the authentication process
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Artefact:} The user authentication process
    \item \textbf{Environment:} Normal execution
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Incorporating a new authentication procedure in the eDocs system does not require changes to any other part of the eDocs system.
            \item A newly introduced authentication procedure should not cause significant noticeable overhead for registered users when logging into or out of the eDocs system
            \item A newly introduced authentication procedure should not cause any noticeable overhead for registered users during their session on the eDocs system
            \item The rollout phase of a newly introduced authentication procedure should be communicated to all registered users in a timely and self-explanatory fashion
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Including a new form of authentication should only delay the authentication procedure of 99\% of all registered users by a maximum of 10 seconds (compared to the original userame-password protection)
            \item The form of authentication during a session is completely transparent to all registered users
            \item Public communication of a new authentication procedure should start at least one month before rollout
            \item A newly introduced authentication procedure should be accompanied with sufficient documentation to satisfy the needs of a test group consisting of at least 30 registered users. This documentation should be sent to all registered users, along with the initial publication (see previous measure)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
